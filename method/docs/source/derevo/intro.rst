Intro to **derevo**
###################

| The **derevo** library is written in a functional style, so classes are used
| only to transfer data, all the functionality is exposed by functions which
| require all of the arguments for their work.
|
| You may want to prepare and re-use such values as available plants list and
| genera cohabitation information.
